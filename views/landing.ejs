    <h2>Nashe Dan <span>/ Founder</span></h2>
    <p>"Hi, I'm a 24 year old man with a grade seven's results slip as my highest academic certification. If you're looking
    to judge my worth and value from first-look appearances, well then, my story is that of failure and dispondency.
    But if you believe in hard work, persistence, hope even in the face of enormous setbacks -- then please, hang around. And hi, I'm Dan üôãüèΩ."</p>

    <p>
      Although the text above is an excerpt from <a href="#">my story</a>, all OUR experiences speak to a broader and
      universal picture.
      That of resilience and faith in oneself and in the deeper sense of 'family' embedded in our social constructs or
      maybe... the lack of it!
    </p>

    <p class="italic">
      I, as you might have as well, have had times when I was young and lacking, naive and in need, youthful and broke...
      times I needed a superhero to come save me but hoped for nought. I made <span class="brand">#weRme</span> to create the saviour(s) I
      couldn't find because I believe YOU are out there. I believe in living for an idea bigger than us. I believe in You and I believe in We!
